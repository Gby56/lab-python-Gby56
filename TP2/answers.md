#Answers for TP2

#Q1
#####- Look at the different pages : how many groups of similar pages do you think there are ?
On the Latin_1168_btv1b8496559r.tar file, it seems that we have around 10 groups, counting the empty pages or covers/side pictures
#Q3
#####- Try different values for the number of clusters. Which value seems to be the best ? How do you know which value works best ? Take screen shots if needed to illustrate your answers in answers.md
11 seems to give us the best results, even if covers should be in their own folder for example, but 12 is not optimal given the fact that some images are split between folders

#####- For the best number of clusters, describe the content of each cluster.
